# roamingEndpoints
This is some vanillaJS code to show how you can have your EOS dApp automatically roam through endpoints.  very helpful for censorship resistance and when an endpoint is overloaded or a user is getting ratelimited.

it goes through a large list of endpoints known for the EOS Mainnet and then pings then and returns an array of the fastest responders.  set to 8 now but you can change that by modifying line 99.
